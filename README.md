1. The correct answer is: A:{}
 Explanation: In this code, a variable greeting is declared, but then, a typographical error occurs when trying to assign an empty object to it. The variable is mistakenly spelled as greetign. So, the correct output of console.log(greetign) will be an empty object, {}, because that's what is assigned to the mistakenly spelled variable.

2. The correct answer is: C: "12" 
Explanation: In the sum function, there is no explicit type checking, and JavaScript will attempt to concatenate the values if one of them is a string. In the function call sum(1, "2"), JavaScript converts the number 1 to a string and then performs string concatenation, resulting in the string "12".

3. The correct answer is: A: ['🍕', '🍫', '🥑', '🍔'] 
Explanation: In this code, the info.favoriteFood is assigned the string "🍝," but this assignment does not affect the food array. The food array remains unchanged, so the console.log(food) will output ['🍕', '🍫', '🥑', '🍔'], option A.

4. The correct answer is: B: Hi there, undefined 
Explanation: In the sayHi function, there is a parameter name, but when you call sayHi() without providing an argument, it defaults to undefined. Therefore, the function returns "Hi there, undefined," which is option B.

5. The correct answer is: B: 2 
Explanation: The forEach loop iterates over the nums array, and for each non-falsy value (in this case, all values except 0), it increments the count variable by 1. So, it will increment count for values 1, 2, and 3, resulting in a final value of 3. Therefore, the console.log(count) will output 3, which corresponds to option C.
